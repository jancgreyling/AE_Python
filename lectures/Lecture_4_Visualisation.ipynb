    "Data visualization is an integral part of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as it allows for a graphical representation of information and data. Python offers a range of libraries tailored for various visualization needs. Here, we'll introduce three of the most popular ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matplotlib**: One of the most widely used visualization libraries in Python, Matplotlib provides a flexible platform to create a vast array of static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It's highly customizable and serves as the foundation for many other plotting libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seaborn**: Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn provides a higher-level interface for creating beautiful, statistically-themed visualizations. It comes with several built-in themes and color palettes to make aesthetically pleasing charts with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plotly**: Unlike the other two, Plotly is mainly known for enabling interactive visualizations. It supports a multitude of chart types and is particularly useful when you want to create visualizations that users can interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with these libraries, you'll first need to import them. Here's how you can do it:\n"
